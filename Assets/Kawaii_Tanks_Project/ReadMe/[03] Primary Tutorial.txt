This tutorial provides the basic knowledge of the objects set in the demo scenes.

(1) Open the demo scene "Test_Field".
     'Kawaii_Tanks_Project' >> 'Kawaii_Tanks_Assets' >> 'Scenes' >> Double click the "Test_Field".


(2) Explore the Hierarchy window.
    You can find the following objects in the Hierarchy window.
    "Directional light", "Terrain" and "Props" are basic objects used for the level design. In this porject, you need to attach any collider into the terrain and the obstacles.
    "Canvas_Images" contains image objects displayed in the runtime such as the aiming marker and the reticle. The image objects instantiated in the runtime should be placed under this canvas.
    "Canvas_Texts" contains text objects displayed in the runtime. The text objects instantiated in the runtime should be placed under this canvas.
    "Game_Controller" controls switching player's tank, restarting the scene and pausing.
    "EventSystem" is required to use Unity GUI components such as a button.
    "SD_Tiger-I_1.1" and "SD_Firefly_1.1" are player's tanks in this scene. The settings of the tank are explained later.

    The minimum required objects to create a new scene are "Canvas_Images", "Canvas_Texts", "Game_Controller" and player's tank.
    When the platform is mobile devices, "EventSystem" is also required.
    Ofcourse, set also your terrain, props and light.
    You can find those prefabs in the 'Scene_Components' folder.
        'Kawaii_Tanks_Project' >> 'Kawaii_Tanks_Assets' >> 'Prefabs' >> 'Scene_Components'

    
(3) How to set the tank.
    The tank can be set by dragging and dropping the prefab into the scene.
    You can find the tank prefabs in the 'Prefab' folder.
        'Kawaii_Tanks_Project' >> 'Kawaii_Tanks_Assets' >> 'Prefabs'

    When there are several tanks in the scene, you need to give an individual ID number to each tank.
    Select the top object of the tank, and set the "Id" in the Inspector window.

This project uses three User Layers to set the tank parts.
'User Layer 9' is used for the wheel.
'User Layer 10' is used for the suspension.
'User Layer 11' is used for the MainBody.

(Note.)
Do not use these User Layers for your remodeling.
If you need to use these User Layers for other assets, change the collision settings in the "Game_Controller_CS" script.

The layer collision matrix in this project is set by "Game_Controller_CS" script at the opening of the scene.

The wheels placed in "User Layer 9" never collide with each other and the MainBody.
The suspension arms placed in "User Layer 10" never collide with any object.
The MainBody placed in "User Layer 11" never collide with the wheels.
